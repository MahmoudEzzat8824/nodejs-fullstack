## Backend

The backend is built using Express.js and connects to a MongoDB database. It includes:

- **Controllers**: Handle the business logic and interact with models.
- **Models**: Define the data structure and interact with the database.
- **Routes**: Define the API endpoints.
- **Middleware**: Handle authentication and other request processing.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure your environment variables.
4. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React. It includes:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components.
- **Services**: Functions for making API calls to the backend.
- **Styles**: CSS styles for the application.

### Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
